									<h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
									<p>Voice Flyers as a company has access to more than 1,00,000 registered users who are willing to 
										avail our service and synchronize our service with their telecom system. The audio ad streams 
										played between the end of the dial and beginning of the call is the time slot where Voice Flyers 
										subconsciously reinforces the brands of the clients into the minds of the customers. Since these 
										ads are short and precise, catering into a customized group, it enables us to serve the best 
										ads to the most relevant customer group hence acquiring high levels of targeting, respective 
										to each brand. The preciseness and the customization of the ads served ensure that the ads 
										are never disturbing for a customer by never waiting him too long for a call to be connected. 
										Instead, the ad keeps him engaging through information or a jingle or a reinforcement quote 
										which subconsciously drives the customer into the brands of our clients. The customers are 
										intern provided benefits from Voice Flyers as a compensation for subscribing to the ad streams 
										and hence both the parties are mutually benefitted in the process.

									<h3>WHY VOICE FLYERS</h3>
									<p>With more advertising companies than the actual number of existing brands, it would be 
										genuine to question the need for one more new entrant into creating brand awareness and 
										reinforcement. Here is where Voice Flyers has a USP that distinguishes our self from the 
										other advertisement firms. Here at Voice Flyers, we concentrate our focus on delivering real 
										One to One ads to the customers. Unlike the ads played on a radio or a television which are 
										primarily one to many ads, delivered to the universal set of all listeners or viewers, the ads 
										served by Voice Flyers is focused on one listener at a time. Hence these ads are more customer 
										centric, communicating on a personal note with the customer without any disturbances in 
										between. Also, since it is the need of the customer to wait for the commencement of the call, 
										the customer hence maintains his attention on the ads much more than a television or a radio 
										ad. Moreover, since we utilize the dead time between the process of dial and call connect 
										and hence subconsciously engage the customers into the ads, it ensures real one to one 
										communication that guarantees the complete focus and attention of the listeners, provided the 
										ads are engaging and customized for this utility. Hence, the ads served in voice flyers would be 
										more customer centric than the ones played on a radio.

									<h3>INTERPHASE &amp; ANALYSIS</h3>
									<p>A proper mapping of the ads played, relative to each client is done by the software, designed so 
										as to enable the clients to get a proper tracking of the ads together with providing exclusivity of 
										the ads relative to the end customer. The software is programmed in such a way that it ensures 
										that the same ads are not repeatedly streamed to the same customers consecutively. This 
										ensures that the ads reach out t the most number of mutually exclusive distinct listeners. The 
										frequency in which the ads are to be delivered to a single customer can be decided by the client 
										as per the customization norms by selecting a package that is in accordance with the desired 
										end result of the client. In any case, a detailed tracking of the ads played over the mentioned 
										time period is sent to the clients. Hence the analysis and mapping of the ads delivered can be 
										constantly accessed by the clients which ensures transparency and enables feedback.
