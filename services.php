							<h4>Gold</h4>
							<p>These are short and precise ads which aim completely aimed at brand reinforcements. The ads can be in 
								the form of a tag line or a jingle of 5 seconds. Hence the gold segment ads of voice flyers are 
								suitable for those brands which are already familiar with the customers, but a continuous 
								reinforcement of which would elevate the brand recall and hence influence the customers at the 
								time of purchase or selection of a service.

						<div class="col-md-4">
							<h4>Diamond</h4>
							<p>The Ads in the diamond model are 10 seconds ads. Together with the reinforcement of the brands of 
								the clients, these ads also aim at communicating a single line of content to the customers apart 
								from the recall and reinforcement. It can be a very brief introduction of a new product, a new 
								outlet or maybe even an offer. Hence, these ads play a dual purpose of reinforcement and communication 
								with the customers.
							</p>

						<div class="col-md-4">
							<h4>Platinum</h4>
							<p>Platinum ads are 15 seconds ads which mainly aim at communicating a content with the customers more 
								than reinforcing the brand. It can be a detailing into an offer for a limited period of time, or 
								guiding the customers for more information into a client outlet or to the client’s website or even 
								communicating the benefits of a service offered by the client to the customers. Hence, the initiation 
								of a detailed enquiry by the customers to the client’s offerings is what is desired.
